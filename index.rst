Welcome to propertea's documentation!
=====================================
.. note::
   This project was created by Tanay, Vincent, Alice, Johnson and Josephine as part of our CZ2006 - Software Engineering Project. We're proud to bring you our first foray into web programming with Python! 🔥🔥

   This project tries to bring you a comprehensive view of any residential property in Singapore, by bringing together data from various government sources and private sources.

Feel free to look around and enjoy our amazing work 😜

Our project consists of these sub-applications:

* Home
* Search
* PropertyInformation
* Users

Our git repository can be found `here`_.
